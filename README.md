# Clone of Zuku clients' portal.

## Overview

This is my final year project where I created a clone for the Zuku self-service portal. I added the online store which was on a separate website as well as creating new modules:
- Invite a friend.
- Change package.
- Raise a ticket.
- Pay for your package.
- View and/or download receipts.

I also fixed an error in the portal for the module ```Moving``` , where a client can request for help in moving houses. The error was that the client couldn't tell whether the request had been received.

## Bugs :bug:
There are plenty. It is very complex and I am still a begineer.
The M-pesa integration is still ongoing and I will push a detailed README.md file on how to clone and run the app.
I am still also working on the email and messaging for the invite a friend feature as well as a discount for when the invited person purchases a decoder.
